## Deployment

This project is deployed on Render.

If you want to publish your own version, configure these environment variables in Render:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
cloudName=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
apiKey=your_cloudinary_api_key
apiSecret=your_cloudinary_api_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

Important notes for production:

- Use a MongoDB Atlas connection string or another hosted MongoDB instance for `MONGO_URI`
- Update the Google OAuth callback URL in your Google Cloud Console to match your Render domain
- The current app code uses a hardcoded session secret and localhost OAuth callback, so those should be updated in code if you want a fully production-ready deployment flow

## Prerequisites

Before running locally, make sure you have:

- Node.js installed
- MongoDB connection string
- Cloudinary account
- Google OAuth credentials for Google login

## Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/innovate-with-pratyush002/StudentRoomHub.git
cd StudentRoomHub
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
cloudName=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
apiKey=your_cloudinary_api_key
apiSecret=your_cloudinary_api_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

4. Start the app:

```bash
node app.js
```

For development:

```bash
npx nodemon app.js
```

5. Open:

```text

## Seed Data

Sample listing data is available in [`init/data.js`](./init/data.js).

To seed the database:

```bash
node init/index.js
```

Note: the seed script clears the existing `Listing` collection before inserting sample data.
